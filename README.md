# Graphics Experiments

I was curious about using Zig and seeing what the language had to offer.  I have also been diving into 3D graphics development and wanted to work with Vulkan on more intermediate to advanced topics.

This has only been tested on Windows 11 using Zig 0.11.0

To run the app just use `zig build run`, make sure to set the environment variable `VK_SDK_PATH` for the Vulkan SDK path on your system.

I might extend this to support [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) in the future as well.
